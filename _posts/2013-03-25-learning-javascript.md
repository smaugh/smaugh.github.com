<p>this post is a copy word by word from the orinal post <a href="http://sivers.org/learn-js"><strong>Learning
JavaScript - my experience and advice</strong></a> by <em> Derek Sivers</em></p>

<p><i>It is posted here for the only purpose of learning from him by memorizing his words</i></p>

<p>Since I've mentioned a few times that I just learned JavaScript over the last
few months, a bunch of people have emailed to ask what I used and recommend to
learn it. So here's my experience and best advice for 2013.</p>
<p>NOTE: I wanted to <b>really learn JavaScript - not shortcuts quick tricks,
or meta-tools </b> that keep me from having to learn JavaScript. I want to learn
it, get it, read it, understand it, and memorize it, so that I can understand all
the other cool things written in JavaScript for years to come. </p>

<p>First -  a bunch of people will tell you to get <i>JavaScript: the Good Parts
- by Douglas Crockford. </i> But when I stated reading it, it was so dense and
succinct that I had no idea what it was talking about! </p>

<p>You know when an expert is talking about their field, and don't know to simplify
it for just anyone? Well, this book felt like it'd be perfect for someone who's
been programming for 20 years in C, Java, and C++, and just needs a quick overview
of what they should know about JavaScript.</p>

<p>But it doesn't really TEACH you. It doesn't guide you through anything. So I
recommend skipping it.</p>

<p>Instead, start with <i>Eloquent JavaScript - by Marijn Haverbeke.</i></p>
<p>It starts so simple, so easy, almost too simple, but this is encouraging. You
get your swagger back as you say, "This is easy!"</p>
<p>Do the online version, here, because you can test and experiment directly in
your browser.</p>

<p>Then, after a few chapters of that, switch over to <i>Professional JavaScript for
Web Developers, 3rd Edition - by Nicholas Zakas.</i></p>

<p><b>THAT is the ultimate tutorial. </b> It takes the time to explain everything
thoroughly, and it covers pretty much everything. Put aside a few hours per chapter,
and <b>by the time you're done with this one book, you'll know as much as most
people who call themselves JavaScript programmers.</b></p>
<p>Funny thing is, I went back to JavaScript: The Good Parts after finishing his
one, and now I understood it. But because Professional JavaScript for Web Developers
was so thorough, it had already covered all of the "good parts", too.</p>
<p>Of course <b> you have to retain what you're learning</b>, so I highly recommend
to write down every new thing your learn, ideally into a flashcard program, like this.
It's a lot to take in, so you''ll have to remind yourself of what you've learned in
the weeks and months afterwards.</p>
<p>If you're in the mood for more books to really solidify JavaScript in your head,
go through:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript Cookbook - By Shelley Powers</li>
<li>Effective JavaScript - by David Herman</li>
<li>Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja- by John Resig and Bear Bibeault</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are great, and you'll notice you go through them much faster now
that you're fluent. Do the examples. Play around.</p>
<h2>Read some real-world JavaScript code</h2>

<p>After a thousand pages of tiny example code snippets, you'll love looking at the
code to two very popular and powerful JavaScript projects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Underscore.js</li>
<li>Backbone.js</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll notice that it all makes sense, now. You're now functionally fluent in
reading and understanding JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Then jQuery, and more...</h2>
<p>jQuery is absolutely everywhere, and you must learn it for your JavaScript tutorial
to be complete.</p>
<p>Now that you've leaned the plain-JavaScript long and verbose way of doing things,
you'll appreciate the shortcuts that jQuery provides.</p>
<p>I really liked <b>Head First jQuery</b> , as goofy as it is. It walks you through
jQuery wonderfully well, and has you apply what you've learned, as you go.</p>
