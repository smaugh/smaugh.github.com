<h2>THE DAILY MIRACLE</h2>

<p>"Yes, he's one of those men that don't know how to manage. Good situation. Regular income.
Quite enough for luxuries as well as needs. Not really extravagant. And yet the fellow's always
in difficulties. somehow he gets nothing out of his money. Excellent flat-- half empty! Always
looks as if he'd had the brokers in. New suit --old hat! Magnificent necktie-- baggy trousers!
Asks you to dinner: cut glass--bad mutton, or Turkish coffee--cracked cup! He can't understand it.
Explanation simply is that he fritters his income away. Wish I had the half of it! I'd show him"
So we have most of us criticized, at one time or other, in our superior way.</p>
<p>
We are nearly all chancellors of the exchequer: it is the pride of the moment. Newspapers are
full of articles explaining how to live on such-and-such a sum, and these articles provoke a
correspondence whose violence proves the interest they excite. Recently, in a daily organ, a
battle raged round the question whether a woman can exist nicely in the country on L85 a year.
I have seen an essay, "How to live on eight shillings a week." But have never seen an essay,
"How to live on twenty-four hours a day." Yet it has been said that time is money. That proverb
understates the case. Time is a great deal more than money. If you have time you can obtain
money -- usually. But though you have the wealth of a cloak-room attendant at the Carlton Hotel,
you cannot buy yourself a minute more time that I have of the by the fire has.

<p>
The supply of time is truly a daily miracle, an affair genuinely astonishing when one examines
it You wake up in the morning and Lo! your purse is magically filled with twenty-four hours of
the unmanufactured tissue of the universe of your life! It is yours. It id the most precious
of possessions. A highly singular commodity, showered upon you in a manner as singular as the
commodity itself!
For remark! No one can take it from you. It is unstealable. an no one receives either more or
less than your recive.</p>
