<h2>Ok this day needs to be recorded: </h2>
<p>here is what happened: First it was the post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5696873">HN thinking mentoring? looking for a mentor? <p>
nicely received with 29 points and 19 comments.
then the offering from the user 

joshcrowder:

"Hi,
An apprenticeship would be great for you. My company offers them we haven't done remote before but I'm willing to give it a go. Drop me an email josh@seriousfox.co.uk"

we contacted and he honored his proposal, so we could start working along with some other apprentice on our own project, as long as it was created in Ruby.
so far this is a work in process...

second point, the user @lifeisstillgood  (also from England) replied to one of my comments: 

> Every company asks for years and years of professional experience.
Nope, every company wants someone who can do the job. Getting past the HR door is the tick box of years of professional experience.
Tell you what, start a company today, walk round to twenty small businesses in the business park nearest you and ask them "if you had a button on your website and the customer could press it, what would that button do?"
Listen to what they say. One of them will be something you can code, and hey presto, real customer, professional experience. 

this is one of the most clever advice ever given!!! 

12 hours after this advice, I am getting my first client.(possibly 2 or 3) :) 

and the story doesn't end there... there is more. Today May 5 2013 Paul Brian @lifeisstillgood twitted to me: 

@_smaugh ok - fancy creating http://HNMentors.com ?  Shall we turn that passion into a real movement?

and 

@_smaugh my tweet-fu failed me. Yr post inspires, HNMentors dot com - would work as a KB and a forum for mentors.

this guy is just brilliant! transform a 30 seconds thought into a product! make it a tool for sharing knowledge, lets give people the chance to meet 
experts, and other to speed their learning, lets help them achieve! 

what a wonderful feeling. 

now I'm working to close a few gigs with small clients, it is a beginning, I am making this happen!


now just wrote again to my first / second client, waiting for his response. 
is not the money is about the portfolio and the mouth to mouth marketing
