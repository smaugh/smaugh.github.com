_What it takes to find a Job in IT?_

These are the obvious options:
<ol>
<li>Sell my work dirt cheap as a freelancer and make enough money to eat and maybe pay the rent</li>
<li>Find my own customers by networking and find the way to sell them my services and hopefully collect at the end of the process,
not forgetting to keep the friendship after finishing the project</li>
<li>Join one or many of the current sites/markets where lots of developers/designers compete for the client  business and only the winner keeps half the money</li>
<li> Succumb to the temptation of going back to Logistics and business analysis, and apply for a job similar to what I was doing in my home country (Colombia)</li>
<li>Keep being strong and apply only to the companies that I think are the best to work in</li>
<li>Pay the hefty amount of AUD 12.300 for a 40 weeks unpaid internship called Professional Year, and expect to be contracted by somebody after that</li>
<li>Forget all the effort and go back to Colombia</li>
<li>Apply for an IT Job outside Melbourne, but not overseas</li>
</ol>

Right now the answer is very easy:

        Work!, keep focus!. Do something today that the future me will thank me for, and seize the day, that the present is all we have.

Forget rejection, create things, work fast and with quality, **People will buy a quality product**

Now, lets be intelligent and find the best approach to land the right job. 
Fist I have to provide them with the skills they are looking in a candidate. This is easy to say but very time consuming to acquire those skills. However,
among the most sought after skills that I have found so far are: PHP, CSS, photoshop, and wide knowledge of usability, and user experience.
These I have (well most of them). Also they ask for a healthy Github account, some point in my Stack overflow account and some karma points the hackerNews community. 

Most of these requirements are also very feasible, but then again they require time. So time is probably the most important variable an the principal restriction, I have. So having <strong>16 hours</strong> available every day to produce output, and <strong>8 days</strong> starting from today to produce as much out put as I can then I have 128 hour to produce and bring the employers to me. Lets do it!.

Now define the priorities for each day and write them on my notepad: today feb 21.
<ul>
 <li>15 pages of the IT companies in Melbourne and at least 10 job applications </li>
 <li>Post the beginning of my project in Github "Job crawler with Python</li>
 <li>Start a New website using the two frameworks I found today</li>
 <li>workout</li>
 <li>Comment in HN at least two and one post</li>
</ul>

lets get going
