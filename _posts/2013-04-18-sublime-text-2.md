<h1>Sublime text 2</h1>
<p>So this is the story of how and why I changed my text editor from Komodo Edit 8.0 to Sublime text 2</p>
<p>list of the amazing features that make sublime text the editor to work in</p>
<ul>
	<li>Learning curve</li>
	<li>environment and presentation, is just too appealing </li>
	<li>speed! lightning fast file creation, opening and editing</li>
	<li>plug-ins and community</li>
	<li>installing plug-ins with Package control</li>
	<li>multiple cursors, is so easy to learn and fancy to use</li>
</ul>
