July 2 2013 Great day to live

today I woke up at 7:00am, went to wake up Jon, realizing that he was already up, doing one of the things he loves most in live (not smoking)

then I updated the career of the Day top post and quote of the day, also downloaded an audiobook to follow on my way to the city. (Perfectly shaved and groomed, headed to the city)

The tram arrived the same minute I arrived to the station. After that, on the tram I dedicated the trip to listen to the  audio-book on think and grow rich. that book is amazing to analyze the bad traits of my personality and keep a positive mental attitude, be thankful of all the thinks that happen in my life and also to push harder to achieve my goals.

On my arrival to the city I went to my favorite bakery "bread top" and bought some buns for me and the rest of Pauline's staff. from there went smiling all the way to the tram and there to the office. (as soon as I got into the office, Pauline greeted me with a big smile, and told me I was her life's savior :)  )

at the office, we had a great laugh all day with Apana, the HR intern, who is amazingly funny and nice with everyone. We all shared the buns and the some tea while chatting happily. 

a while later, I helped Pauline moving the new domain name to our new hosting provider. I t was a little frustrating at the beginning but then it became a lot easier when we took into account that we only had to point the name servers to the new provider, ( a lot easier than how it sounds)

- Sun shined all day

- Got paid!
