Then one day I read an article that lifted me out of my despondence and gave me the courage to go on living.
I shall never cease to be grateful for one inspiring sentence in that article. It said: "Every day is a new
life to a wise man." I typed that sentence out and pasted it on the windshield of my car, where I saw it every
minute I was driving. I found it wasn't so hard to live only one day a t a time. I learned to forget the
yesterdays and to not-think of the tomorrows. Each morning I said to myself: "today is a new life."

"I have succeeded in overcoming my fear of loneliness, my fear of want. I am happy and fairly successful now
and have a lot of enthusiasm and love for life. I know now that I shall never again be again, regardless
of what life hands me. I know now that I don;t have to fear the future. I know now that I can live one day
at a time-and that "Every day is anew life to a wise man."

 One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put of living. We are all
 dreaming of some rose garden over the horizon-instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our
 windows today.


Life "is in living, in the tissue of every day and hour." 

Five hundred years before Christ was born, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus told his students that "everything
changes except the law of change". He said: "You cannot step in the same river twice." The river changes every
second; and so does the man who stepped in it. Life is a ceaseless change. The only certainty is today.
Why mar the beauty of living today by trying to solve the problems of a future that is shrouded with ceaseless
change and uncertainty a future that no one can possibly foretell? 

The old Romans had a word for it. In fact, they had two words for it. Carpe diem. "Enjoy the day."or
"Seize the day." Yes, seize the day, and make the most of it.
