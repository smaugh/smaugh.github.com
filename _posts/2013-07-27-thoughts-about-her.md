today in the morning 
kachi called ely at 10am (meaning 2am for kachi)
the chatted playfully and planned that kachi is coming to Australia in the near future.
some time in October, from what i heard. The thing is that Ely hasn't told me anything 
neither has Jon. I don't know what to think. neither should I care. 
The thing is: she is far, we don't have any kind of relation, not even friends. And what
ever she does is not my business. 

I should only focus in me! is it me what matters to me. How can I become a better person in every
single way. what I have to do to become more confident, have o more pleasant personality. The things 
I have to change to get better friends and enjoy more every minute. What is the work and effort that 
I need to apply in order to make money, be successful, achieve the goals I pursuit.

The girls that I have to talk to and meet and befriend and laugh with. Overcome scarcity! meet many people
make more friends, laugh more, enjoy listening to their stories. 

Find love, and become so awesome that the day she is back, she will feel very attracted to my charming personality 
that she will be the one seeking to have me back. 
then I will have the power to choose if I want her back or if I want to move on with other amazing woman

do something every day to improve my ability to make new friends.
