July 15 2013 

Today I have worked and done most of the things that I purposed during the day
went to the gym and finish the work assigned by Pauline

however in the case of kachi 

first during her morning  she was connected and I wrote her a couple of lines and she didn't answer
1 strike

second I wrote her during her afternoon trough gmail and she answered very dry and then disconnected in the middle of the conversation
2 strike

third, she appeared on-line on Skype, so I asked her for a minute of her time, but no answer. finally something but not polite "I am having lunch, write to you later" 
and then disconnected again

sad sad, but more than anything very rude. :( 

it is the time to forget everything, she is being terrible rude to me. 

that should be all, no more tears just move on.
