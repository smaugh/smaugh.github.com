July 15 2013 

Today I have worked and done most of the things that I purposed during the day
went to the gym and finish the work assigned by Pauline

however in the case of kachi 

first during her morning  she was connected and I wrote her a couple of lines and didn't answered 
1 strike

second I wrote her during her afternoon trough gmail and she answered very dry and then disconnected
2 strike

third, she appeared on-line in Skype, so I asked her for a minute of her time, but no answer. 

sad sad, but more than anything very rude. :( 

it is the time to forget everything, she is being terrible rude to me. 

that should be all, no more tears just move on.
